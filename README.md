Zabbix topology pseudo code in VB. 
This is a hastly written piece of pseudo code which I wrote in VB.Net ahead of porting the final solution into C. I am not proud of the way this code is written and I do not put this forward as a clever or good way to write code, but in case anyone wants access to this in the future I am placing it here.

It may give you some insight into my thought process if problems are later found with the C code.
